# Description

  The FidoCadJ format is a way to store technical drawings and electronic
  circuits in a very compact text, easy to embed in an Usenet, forum
  messages and web pages. FidoReadJS is a reader written in JavaScript able
  to convert on the fly these drawings and show them on your web site.
